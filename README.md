# Morning Report 

This is a personal automation project that sends a **daily morning report** to your phone with:

- 🌡️ The day's weather forecast (from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/))
- 👕 Clothing advice based on the temperature and weather conditions
- 🚇 Live status updates for all London Underground (TfL) tube lines (from [api.tfl.gov.uk](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/))

The report is delivered to your phone every morning at **7:00 AM** using [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).

## Features

- Fetches **daily weather data** for London using WeatherAPI
- Generates smart **clothing advice** (e.g. *"Take a jacket, it might rain!"*)
- Connects to **TfL API** to check live status of all tube lines
- Sends the combined report to your **Pushover app** on mobile

├── main.py # Main script that coordinates weather, advice, TfL, and notification
├── weather.py # Fetches weather forecast from WeatherAPI
├── advice.py # Generates clothing advice based on the forecast
├── tfl_status.py # Retrieves live status updates from TfL API
├── notifier.py # Sends the final message to Pushover
├── daily_run.py # Used by GitHub Actions to run the whole pipeline
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
├── .github/workflows/
│ └── daily-notification.yml # GitHub Actions workflow to run daily at 7am
└── environmentvariables.env # Stores environment variables (not committed)


## Secrets & Environment Variables

The app uses the following environment variables (stored securely as GitHub Repository Secrets):

- `WEATHER_API_KEY` — Your WeatherAPI key
- `LAT` and `LON` — Coordinates for your location (e.g. London)
- `PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN` — Token from your Pushover app
- `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY` — Your Pushover user key
- `TFL_APP_ID` and `TFL_APP_KEY` — Your credentials for the TfL API (optional)

---

## How It Works

1. GitHub Actions runs the workflow every morning at 7:00 AM (London time)
2. The workflow executes `daily_run.py`
3. This script:
   - Fetches today’s forecast and clothing advice
   - Retrieves the status of all London tube lines
   - Formats a summary message
   - Sends it to your phone via Pushover

## Example Notification

Good morning!

Today in London: 16°C, cloudy with a chance of rain.
Recommendation: Wear a light jacket and bring an umbrella.

Tube Status:

Victoria: Good Service

Central: Minor delays

Piccadilly: Part Closure ....

## Future Improvements

- Add location-based TfL updates with commute to work estimation
- Add alternative route suggestions if there are train cancellations or delays
- Add daily email report option

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the idea of getting actionable insights (like what to wear or which tube line to avoid) before even getting out of bed.
